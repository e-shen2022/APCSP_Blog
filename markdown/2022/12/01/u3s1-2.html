<p>Q3 254 –&gt; binary</p>

<p>My Answer: 11111111</p>

<p>Correct Answer: 11111110</p>

<p>Answer explanation: I forgot that the decimal place on the very right indicates if the number is odd or not. Since 254 is even, I know that the digit on very right should be 0, not 1.</p>

<p>Correct Answer: 6. 1, 4</p>

<p>Answer explanation: I momentarily forgot that index starts at 0, therefore Avocado in the list would be index 4</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>
Today I learned about variables, how to name them, types of variables, lists, and binary numbers. 
String –&gt; a word or group of characters not be changed numerically, just a phrase (ex. “hello”, “858-705-5930”)</p>

<p>Boolean –&gt; True of False</p>

<p>Integer –&gt; whole number</p>

<p>Float –&gt; number with decimal point</p>

<p>Name a variable thoughtfully, not just randomly. (ex. If you were naming a boolean variable to determine if an object is the color pink, name the variable isPink.)</p>

<p>Lists - you can combine lists together, and have multiple types of variables in a list</p>

<p>Converting binary to decimal numbers is just a matter of knowing what each decimal point represents.</p>
