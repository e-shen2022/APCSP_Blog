My biggest takeaway is to focus on what I can control. If I were to not win a lottery, I should realize that it was up to chance and there was nothing I could do to make me win, I shouldn't spend any negative emotions on a situation I have no control over. However, when it comes to pursuing happiness, I do need to take effort to do things that bring me joy and surround myself with people I love. In this way, we won't tie our self worth to our salary, where we live, etc. because we can be content with our life in any circumstance.

I learned that things like your salary or your job aren't what necessarily make you happy, rather data shows that people who spend more time engaging in social activities feel more happy overall. This goes along with being time affluent and avoiding burnout.

A student's life is mostly centered around learning. A student will need to show evidence of their learning in almost every lesson they attend. Concentrating on their work and employing effective study techniques are two approaches to assist students in learning. We must value our time, as Laurie Santos discussed in her address. If we value our time, we have more of it and may use it to enhance our mental health. There are various ways we may make the most of our time. For instance, we may efficiently spend our time by concentrating on our task, doing it quickly, and avoiding rushing it at the last minute. In accordance with Laurie Santos's discourse, we should also exercise self-control and develop healthy routines.When you have the opportunity to work hard and have a break from your responsibilities, you should do so. These actions would improve your academic performance as well as your general wellbeing since they would reduce the amount of homework you have to complete at home.

From the video, I learned that small things like money and grades won't necessarily happier. An experiment showed that participating in activities like giftgiving can help make a person much happier.
