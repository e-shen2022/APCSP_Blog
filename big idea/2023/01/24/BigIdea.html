<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles</strong>
Projects that include PII on a project in CSP is seen on the login page. When people login to a site on our website, their information includes their name and their email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?</strong>
I think PIIs have the potential to be dangerous because people are able to stalk you online and I don’t want to be stalked. However, PII’s are necessary for login and user experience so it is important to be sure that the information you are giving is to a secure website where your information will not be stolen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A good password is one that can not be guessed by other people and does not include any personal information.</li>
      <li>A bad password is 1234567890 or something that can be easily guessed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.</strong>
-<mark>Symmetric Encryption</mark>: Method of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption; is fast and efficient (SECRET KEY)
-<mark> Asymmetric Encryption</mark>: encryption that uses two different keys for encryption and decryption. The public key, is used for encrypting the data and shared widely, and the private key, is used for decrypting the data and must be kept confidential.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>AES-256 encryption</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.</strong>
-A phishing scheme I have seen are people scamming personal information through fake lotteries. People send text messages saying you won $100 dollars and will ask for your address and other personal info. Bad!
    <ul>
      <li>Other phishing include malicious websites, voice mail messages, or email.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>5.5 Legal &amp; Ethical Concerns</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><mark>MIT License</mark></p>
<ul>
  <li>Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software</li>
  <li>minimal restrictions on the use of the software and allows it to be used in commercial and non-commercial projects</li>
  <li>allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the licensed software for any purpose, including commercial use, as long as the original copyright and license notices are included</li>
</ul>

<p><mark>GPL License</mark></p>
<ul>
  <li>Freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software: Users of the software are free to use it for any purpose, make changes to it, and distribute it, either for free or for a fee</li>
  <li>source code of the software must be made available to anyone who receives a copy of the software</li>
  <li>no discrimination</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Software licenses determine the terms and conditions under which software can be used, modified, and distributed.</li>
  <li>Digital rights, such as privacy and intellectual property rights, are important in considering ethical concerns. For example, in the case of music, licensing can prevent music from being pirated so that artists can take credit for their work.</li>
  <li>This is important for software coders because it allows creators to control their creations and protect their rights to avoid other people stealing their data.</li>
  <li>Software licenses, digital rights, and legal and ethical considerations are all complex and interrelated topics that impact the development, distribution, and use of software.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Make a license for your personal</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>An MIT License allows for greater flexibility in the use of the software. GPL license is requires derivative works be licensed under the same terms as the original software. We chose the MIT license for greater flexibility. It is easier to distribute code, which can be beneficial to other users.</p>

<p><strong>5.4 Crowdsourcing</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
</strong>    <ul>
      <li>A crowdsource idea relates to a project I am working on right now. I am developing this app with my friend called <mark>Grow &amp; Give</mark>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a little exerpt about it: 
Student productivity has plummeted following the COVID-19 pandemic. Nationwide test scores, specifically California, are at an all-time low which signal lower engagement and morale among elementary to high school students. A reason for this decrease in academic performance is the fact that children have difficulties taking the time to plan a goal, start their task, and take needed breaks in between. Thus, our app aims to guide them through this journey and give them the incentive to convert their productive minutes to in-game coins which will accumulate to donate money to support real-world causes such as planting a tree, taking a pound of trash from the ocean, and providing educational and academic materials to underserved kids. In this way, we are not only building focused intelligent minds, but also setting a strong moral foundation for children to build off of as they grow up to contribute social good to their community and workplace</p>

<p>It was just recently published to the app store, and we want to test its effectiveness using a week-long study. In this experiment, we want as many elementary to highschool students from different ethnicities and backgrounds to use our app for 7 consecutive days. We can crowdsource by mentioning on announcements that is to all students and sent out mass survey form to get people to sign up and input their email.</p>

<p>Here is a picture where we demoed our app at Design 39 2/3/2023 where we attempted to crowdsource by getting the students interested in our study and leaving their email so we can do mass testing

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Our project is better with crowdsourcing to gain more accurate functionality for a certain target audience. For example, since our project is aimed to teenagers who want to improve their skin care we can send survey and get info about their routine now and what they feel like they are missing in taking care of their skin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.</strong>
Some data we can collect for our CPT project is before they use our website how they feel about their skin then and how they want it to improve, then after they use our website how useful they found it</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>5.3 Computer Bias</strong></p>

<p><strong>Intentional bias:</strong>
Ex. Tiktok: based on your view time, which videos you like and comment → recommends you more content and tiktokers similar to what you have liked before → pushes you to believe and identify in specific niche → increases interaction time which is what Tiktok wants</p>

<p><strong>Unintentional bias</strong>
Ex. One recent story takes place in 2019 when Optum, a health services algorithm that predicts which patients benefit most from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental prejudice against black patients. The algorithm used how much money a patient spends on healthcare as a measure of how healthy they are; however, since black patients face disproportionate levels of poverty and often spend less on health care than whites, the algorithm falsely concluded that blacks were healthier than equally sick white patients → discriminatory-based system unfairly reduced healthcare funding for black patients, putting their well-being at risk.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms that affect my decisions</strong>
Rotten tomato ratings affect what movies people choose to watch
Amazon: After you buy a product, it shows you what other people have bought with that product → prompt consumerism → makes people buy more things that they haven’t wouldn’t have in the first place</p>

<p><strong>Virtual assistants have female voices</strong>
Sexism - believe women are meant to assist others. They are the “soothing” voice that will help you with all your needs</p>

<p><strong>HP computers are racist </strong>
Probably based algorithm off of only white faces (not diverse data set)
Did not train algorithms to account for darker faces 
Either disregarded darker faces when testing product / ignored the fact cannot detect → either way is intentional bias</p>

<p>For our CPT project I will make sure to prevent any kind of bias. We will do this by using wide diverse data set that considers all different skin products for various skin types and tones.</p>

<p><strong>5.2 Digital Divide</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</strong>
The top course of action that would empower someone in the digital world is getting access to a piece of technology to become familiar with the internet. In this way they can develop digital literacy skills and learn to navigate technology and understand the risks and benefits. Further, with easy access to any topic they want at their fingertips, they can continuously learn and stay informed about digital developments. They can also take advantage of mass networking platforms that allow people to create a positive online presence and connect with those they otherwise would’ve never been able to conctact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</strong>
“Someone who is empowered” can be interpreted in many ways. It could be someone who is more knowledgable in a certain area, in a higher economic stance, or just more confident in theirself and identity. In addressing this broad definition, here are a few ways you can empower someone who is inferior to you in some aspect:
    <ul>
      <li>Share knowledge and skills.</li>
      <li>Be a mentor or coach.</li>
      <li>Advocate for digital equality and accessibility.</li>
      <li>Collaborate on digital projects.</li>
      <li>Support and uplift underrepresented communities online
Specifically at Del Norte, you can become a WHAT tutor to help underclassmen in their essay writing, or volunteer at the nighthawk tutoring session where you can tutor students all different subjects that you are interested in. Further, clubs like National Honor Society are a great way to give back to your community and help underserved communities in their basic needs and education.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</strong>
A main barrier at Del Norte is the financial barrier. Not all families are able to afford a personal computer for their children. Some ways we can raise awareness and help these people are:
    <ul>
      <li>Providing digital literacy training and education.</li>
      <li>Partner with community organizations to bridge the digital divide.</li>
      <li>Advocate for government policies that support digital access for all.</li>
      <li>Create and support public spaces with technology access, such as community centers or libraries.</li>
      <li>Collaborate with technology companies to donate equipment and support digital access initiatives.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing</li>
</ol>

<p><mark>Benefits</mark></p>
<ul>
  <li>Computing allows us to create technological devices that make our lives easier. For example, just one device, the iPhone, has revolutionized communication, safety, and access to knowledge. With good service and wifi, we can contact anyone we want from wherever we want. In times of danger if we feel unsafe we can call 911 which will send help our way in the matter of seconds. If we want to learn how to cook a meal, what the cube root is of 64, and why fruit is good for you, the phone is a mobile device that makes it possible for us to access the answers to these questions anywhere.</li>
  <li>Computing can analyze and categorize mass data at a speed and accuracy that humans cannot. The applications of AI have taken over from the health to the transportation industry.For example, there is computer software designed to help screen for cancers. Computers can scan through millions of possible signs of cancer and give a positive or negative result in less than a few minutes. Scientists are also using computers to help invent new methods of curing diseases with protein sequence pattern matching.</li>
  <li>Innovative computer software can help those who are disadvantaged or have physical disabilities. For example, Stephen Hawking used a computer to speak, which wouldn’t be as easy without a computer. Computers are also great tools for the blind; special software (screen reader), can read what is on the screen. Computers and computer-controlled devices help increase a better quality of life for many different types of people.</li>
</ul>

<p><mark>Harms </mark></p>
<ul>
  <li>A clear harm of computing is that when technology makes our life easier, our brains are getting dumber. ChatGPT is a prime example. While it is a very useful for students to get answers to their questions who is good temporarily to get homework done, it is negative long-term when the student needs to recall this information on a test.</li>
  <li>While machine learning and data mining have greatly benefitted many fields, their findings are also susceptible to biases and may unintentionally contribute to discrimination. One recent story takes place in 2019 when Optum, a health services algorithm that predicts which patients benefit most from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental prejudice against black patients. The algorithm used how much money a patient spends on healthcare as a measure of how healthy they are; however, since black patients face disproportionate levels of poverty and often spend less on health care than whites, the algorithm falsely concluded that blacks were healthier than equally sick white patients. Here it can be seen that computing is NOT perfect. In fact, it is seen as beneath humans because it is not capable of taking into account social factors such as race.</li>
  <li>Replacement of humans by computing innovations, leading to the loss of previously existing jobs and economic hardship for the now-unemployed workers</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe that dopamine issues caused by overuse of technology is true. Social media and video games are designed to make you addicted to checking and playing them. Spending so much time recieving “short-term” pleasure from playing games on your computer will decrease your joy in other ordinary actions that usually bring you dopamine such as exericising. For me personally, I have found it harder to get out of bed and find joy in the small things when I spend multiple hours a day just staring at a screen.</p>
