Cheese Quesadilla . Exercise 2 . Make a flowchart(here is one we used) and write pseudocode for the following scenario. . Mr. Yeung would like to grade live reviews. | He wants to see if each student has at least 2 issues on their project. If they don&#39;t they receive a score of 2.0. | If they have at least 2 issues, check that they have completed at least 5 of their scrumboard tasks. | If they have completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give the student a 2.7. If they have not completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give them a score of 2.5. If they have completed more than 5 tasks, give them a score of 3.0. | How much would a student with 3 issues and 1 complete scrumboard task receive? | . Lesson Takeaways: . For Binary to Decimal conversions and vice versa, I need to remember that each decimal place is to the power of 2 | if statement and if-else statements are different: if statements only preform if statement is met, if-else goes through code no matter is statement is met | I can use dictionaries and nested if statements to create a program that solves real-world problems | Sketching out a flow chart in psuedo code allows me to clear my algorithm logic. | .",

Repeat until reach gray square: If (can_moveForward) Move_Forward Else (can_moveRight) { Rotate_Right Move_Forward } . (4) Make a binary search tree of different the list [1,2,3,4,6,9,11,69] . See image in issue . (5) Explain thorughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) . To find 69 using sequential search, the list would be iterated 7 times. Using a binary search instead, this process would be much more efficient. The search would start from the middle index, then going to the first and last index and dividing by two. This process goes through until the number 69 is found. . (6) Make a diagram explaining how you found the list (not tree, include equation) . see image in issue . (7) Put this list of strings in a order that can be used for binary search [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . (8) Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is quicker than sequential search because binary search takes out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut. . (9) [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . I would be searching for 36. First, I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and since 16 &lt; 36, I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36. . See issue for image . SUMMARY . Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. | Sequential Search (Inefficient search): compare each number to the number you want to find until you get to the number you want to find | Binary Search (Efficient search): repeats the process of finding a median and evaluating | Boolean Expressions: expression that evaluates to either true or false | Truth Tables: displays the logical operations on input signals in a table format, identifies all possible input combinations and the output for each | .",

            "content": "OUR TEAM SIZE PROJECT . Problem: 60% of Americans feel uncomfortable about their skin and don’t know how to treat it . Solution: CSP (Customized Skin Products) --&gt; A fast &amp; free website that caters to our user’s specific skin type to recommend quality skin care products &amp; services that range from a face cleanser to a professional dermatologist in their area . Purpose: . Help people of all ages to gain a thorough understanding of their own skin and how to treat it | Develop a skincare routine to ensure long-term maintenance of clear and healthy skin | Uplift inner and outer confidence! Looking good and feeling good to feel comfortable engaging with those around us and showing our personality to our full potential | Audience: Pre-tween kids to young adults dealing with pubescent &amp; stress blemeches. Most vulnerable to future self-esteem issues stemming from skin problems . MY INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION: Based on user-input from skin-type quiz, generate top 3 recommendations for a face cleanser product . HOW I PLAN TO FULFILL THE CB RUBRIC . Row 1: Program Purpose &amp; Function . In the video: I will pretend I am a user and fill out the multiple choice skin-type quiz (input). Once I press generate results, it will show the output which is an in-depth evaluation of my skin type and how to treat it. Then, when I press on the &quot;face cleansers&quot; tab, it will show 3 products personally recommended. All of this together will show program functionality . | In the written response (3A): I will clearly explain the overall purpose AND function. . | Function: CSP (Customized Skin Products) --&gt; A fast &amp; free website that caters to user’s specific skin type to produce in-depth evaluation of how to improve and recommend quality skin care product. . Purpose: Help teenagers to gain a thorough understanding of their own skin and how to treat it. Uplifting inner and outer confidence so that they feel comfortable engaging with those around them and showing their personality to their full potential. . Clarify input and output: input (user-inputted skin-type quiz) &amp; output (skin-type evaluation + face cleanser recommendation) . Row 2: Data Abstraction . In the written response (3B): . Code segment shows how data is being stored in a list --&gt; I plan to create an array with all the quiz questions and loop through them | Code segment shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose --&gt; in recommendation function, will show that I am looping through questions and if user&#39;s answer matches with a product&#39;s assigned answer, add one point to that recommended product. | Identifies name of variable representing list being used --&gt; quizQs | Describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program --&gt; data contained in list represents questions that user will be asked to determine what their skin-type is and what face cleanser recommendation they should recieve | Row 3: Managing Complexity . In the written response (3B): . Explains how list manages complexity + why vital to program: If program were to run without the &quot;quizQs&quot; list, it would make everything very inefficient because I would have to make new individual variables to store each question. By using &quot;quizQs&quot;, I can consolidate all that information in one place, making it easier to use and keep track of. | Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . In the written response (3C): . Code segment that shows student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effeect on the functionality of the procedure: I will create a recommendation function called &quot;faceCleanserRec&quot; which will take user&#39;s input to each question and +1 to the corresponding variable. Then whichever variable is the max will be printed as the recommended product. | Code segment where student-developed procedure is being called: I will show place where &quot;faceCleanserRec&quot; will be called | Describes identified procedure does and how contribute to overall functionality of the program: This recommendation function contributes to my project&#39;s key feature which is giving custom product recommendation. Without this backend code, when the user submits their quiz they will recieve no result | Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . In the written response (3C): . Code Segment in student-developed procedure that shows: | sequencing: Code runs in order from line at top to line at bottom (starts with list of questions --&gt; recommendation function to output face cleanser) | iteration: iterates through list of questions | selection: if/else statements to check which variable is the max to output what product to recommend | . Explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it --&gt; will walk through entire algorithm line by line | Row 6: Testing . In the written response (3D): . 1st call: question asks &quot;Would you describe your skin as oily, dry, or a combination of both?&quot; &amp; user chooses answer choice &quot;oily&quot; 2nd call: question asks &quot;What is your age?&quot; &amp; user chooses age group 14 - 17 years old . 1st condition: if user chooses oily, 1 point is added to variable called &quot;CetaPhil&quot; which is a face cleansing brand that is good for oily skin 2nd call: if user chooses answer option 14-17 years old, 1 point is added to variable called &quot;humanAcne&quot; which is a face washer good for teenage acne . 1st result: One of top 3 face cleanser recommendations will be one from CetaPhil 2nd call: one of top 3 face cleanser recommendations will be for teenage acne .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

This might be more interesting if nums we generated to be a lot bigger. | . import ray # define a simple function that takes a number and returns its square def square(x): return x * x # initialize Ray ray.init() # create a remote function that squares a list of numbers in parallel @ray.remote def square_list(nums): return [square(num) for num in nums] # define a list of numbers to square nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # split the list into two parts split_idx = len(nums) // 2 part1, part2 = nums[:split_idx], nums[split_idx:] # call the remote function in parallel on the two parts part1_result = square_list.remote(part1) part2_result = square_list.remote(part2) # get the results and combine them result = ray.get(part1_result) + ray.get(part2_result) # print the result print(result) .",

            "content": "Objectives: . Students will be able to... . Understand the concept of data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and 2D arrays | Learn how to iterate through data structures using loops | Able to visualize data structures and iteration processes | Able to apply their knowledge to build simulations/interactions using lists and iteration | Learn how to store list and dictionary content in databases | . Lesson 1: Lists and Iteration . Lists (Ethan) . Lists are a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a single variable | Lists are defined using square brackets [ ] | Each item in a list is separated by a comma | Lists are indexed, starting at 0 | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;] print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Accessing Lists . To access individual items in a list, we use the index of the item. | Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item in the list has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on. | . print(fruits[0]) print(fruits[2]) . apple orange . Slicing Lists . We can also extract a specific portion of a list using slicing. | We use the colon : operator to specify a range of indices to include. | . print(fruits[0:2]) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;] . Modifying List Items . Lists are mutable, meaning that we can change the value of an item in a list. | To change the value of an item in a list, we can use the indexing operator (square brackets) to access the item and then assign a new value to it. | . fruits[2] = &quot;pear&quot; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Adding and Removing List Items . Adding . Use the append() method to add an item to the end of a list. | . fruits.append(&quot;kiwi&quot;) # Adds &#39;kiwi&#39; to the end of the list print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the insert() method to add an item to a specific index in a list. | . fruits.insert(1, &quot;peach&quot;) # Inserts &quot;peach&quot; at index 1 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Removing . Use the remove() method to remove the first occurrence of an item from a list. | . fruits.remove(&#39;pear&#39;) # Removes the first occurrence of &#39;pear&#39; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the pop() method to remove the item at a specific index from a list. | . fruits.pop(2) # Removes the item at index 2 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the clear() method to remove all items from a list. | . fruits.clear() # Removes all items from the list print(fruits) . [] . Function Explanation . InsertToList . This function is designed to insert a new item into a list at a specific index. | It first retrieves the new item to be added and the index at which to add it from the HTML document. | It checks if the retrieved values are both valid integers and if the index is within the range of the list. | If the values are valid, the function uses the splice() method to insert the new item into the list at the specified index. | In JavaScript, the splice() method modifies an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements. | The splice() method takes three arguments:the index at which to start changing the list, the number of elements to remove, and the new item to add. - The item is inserted without removing any elements, so we pass 0 as the second argument. | Finally, the function calls the visualizeList() function to display the updated list on the web page. | . // Get the value of the new item and the index where it should be inserted function insertToList() { let newItem = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;newItem&quot;).value); let index = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;index&quot;).value); if (!isNaN(newItem) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(index) &amp;&amp; index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt;= myList.length) { // splice() method to insert the new item into the list myList.splice(index - 1, 0, newItem); // Call the visualizeList() function to update the display of the list visualizeList(); } } . SortList . In JavaScript, sort() is a built-in method used to sort the elements of an array in place. The default sort order is ascending, but you can also specify a descending sort order. | In this case, the function sorts myList in ascending order based on their numerical value. | . // Sort myList array in ascending order function sortList() { // The function a - b is used, which subtracts the second element b from the first element a. // If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is zero, the order of the elements is unchanged. myList.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b); visualizeList(); } . Applications of Lists . Data processing: Lists are commonly used to store and process large amounts of data. In data analysis and machine learning, lists are often used to store datasets. . | Gaming: Lists are used extensively in game development to store game objects, player statistics, and game maps. . | Finance: Lists are used in finance to store and process financial data, such as stock prices and market trends. The data from these lists can also be used to calculate financial metrics and to create financial models. . | . Iteration (Alex) . What is iteration? . In programming, iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. This can be achieved using loop structures like for loops and while loops. | . For Loops . A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a list, tuple, string, etc.) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a for loop in Python: | . sequence = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] for variable in sequence: print(variable) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . my_string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; for character in my_string: print(character) . H e l l o , W o r l d ! . While Loops A while loop is used to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a while loop in Python: . num = 0 while num &lt; 5: print(num) num += 1 . 0 1 2 3 4 . Applications of Iteration . Iteration is a fundamental concept in computer programming and is used in a variety of real-life applications. Here are some examples:Data Processing . Data processing often involves iterating over large datasets to perform specific operations on each element. For example, in a data analysis task, you might iterate over a list of numbers to compute the average, or iterate over a list of strings to find the longest string. | . User Interfaces . User interfaces often involve iteration to display and handle data from various sources. For example, in a web application, you might iterate over a list of users to display their information in a table. Similarly, in a desktop application, you might iterate over a list of files to display them in a file explorer. | . Machine Learning . Machine learning algorithms often involve iterative processes to train models and improve their accuracy. For example, in a gradient descent algorithm, you might iterate over a set of training data to update the model&#39;s parameters and minimize the loss function. | . Popcorn hack (0.3) . Make a list related to your CPT project ✅ | Make a for loop that will print each term in the list ✅ | Make a while loop that will print each term in the list ✅ | Explain mechanics behind the loop works ✅ | . Explanation for code below: . I first created a list called fibromyalgia_symps that stores the sicknesses fibromyalgia&#39;s symptoms | The for loop iterates through each item in that list and prints it until all the symptoms have been looped through | . fibromyalgia_symps = [&#39;Fatigue&#39;, &#39;Depression&#39;, &#39;Anxiety&#39;, &#39;Insomnia&#39;, &#39;Headache&#39;] #For loop for symptom in fibromyalgia_symps: print(symptom) .

Check In: &#9989; . Of the above code segments, which is a list and which is a dictionary? | . The first code segment is a dictionary, the 2nd is a list . What is a dictionary and how is it used? | . A dictionary is a type of 2D array that matches key-value pairs. It allows us to associate a value to a unique key, and then to quickly access this value. . What is a 2D Array? | . Arrays where the data element&#39;s position is referred to by two indices. The name specifies two dimensions, like row and column, i and j . How are 2D Arrays different from 1D Arrays or Lists and what can they be used for? | . 1D arrays are just one row of values, while 2D arrays contain a grid of values that has several rows/columns. @d are especially useful when the data is naturally organized in rows and columns like in a spreadsheet, bingo, battleship, theater seats, classroom seats, or a picture .

A unique set of numbers that identifies a device (computer/phone) on the internet/network and allows the device to send and recieve information to another device on the same internet/network. | . 2. What is a TCP port? . It&#39;s like a numbered gateway that allows data to flow in and out of a device over a network. Each port is identified with a unique # between 0 and 65535, and specific applications/services are associated with specific port #s. Ex. web traffic sent over port 80 or 443, email traffic uses port 25 or 587 | An easy way to think about it is that it is like a road that allows your car know where to go. | Purpose: By using different port numbers, multiple services/applications can run at the same time on the same device without interfering with each other&#39;s network traffic. | . Slide Hacks . 1. What does DNS stand for? . Domain Name Service . 2. What is the purpose of DNS? . Its purpose is to assign an IP address to each domain name. Its purpose is to act like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites and other online resources by their familiar names rather than obscure numerical IP addresses. . 3. How does DNS work? . When you type a domain name like www.googledocs.com into your web browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server, asking for the IP address associated with that domain name. The DNS server then looks up the IP address associated with the domain name in its database, and sends it back to your computer. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the server hosting the website you requested. . 4. What is a DNS resolver? . It is a computer program or service that helps your device find the IP address associated with a domain name you want to access on the internet. When you type in a domain name in your web browser, the DNS resolver translates that name into a corresponding IP address so that your device can connect to the appropriate server and display the website or other online resource you requested. . with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s: s.connect((ip, 80)) # Send a GET request to &quot;/&quot; s.sendall(b&quot;GET / HTTP/1.1 r n r n&quot;) # Recieve &amp; print 2048 bytes of data data = s.recv(2048) print(data.decode()) .

When a client sends a request to a server, it includes an HTTP header, which contains additional info ab request/client. . &quot;Content-Type&quot; header - The purpose of this header is to provide information to the server about the type of data that is being sent in the body of the HTTP request or response. . Ex. if a client sends a POST request to a server with a JSON payload in the body, the Content-Type header would be set to &quot;application/json&quot;. This tells the server that the body of the request contains JSON data and helps the server understand how to parse and process the data. Similarly, when a server sends a response back to the client, it includes a Content-Type header that specifies the type of data being sent. This is important because the client needs to know how to interpret the data. . 2. Write a line in a sample NGINX configuration that will add that specific header to the `/information` location . &quot;add_header Date $date_gmt;&quot; . 3. Explain the purpose of the load balancing performed by NGINX . The purpose of load balancing performed by NGINX is to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances. This helps make websites faster and more reliable by dividing incoming traffic across multiple servers or computers, preventing one server from getting too much traffic and slowing down the website. . 4. Modify the following code block to obtain the value of the secret header on `/products` of the AWS site ✅ . import requests aws = &quot;3.130.255.192&quot; response = requests.get(&quot;http://&quot; + aws + &quot;/products&quot;) secret_header = response.headers.get(&#39;X-Cooler-Header&#39;) print(&quot;The secret header is:&quot;, secret_header) . The secret header is: This is my secret header! . Hacks . Complete the above check-in questions and change the hosts ✅ | Complete the above code-segment to retrieve the secret header ✅ | . Bonus (0.05) . Create a diagram showing the layers of abstraction that allow us to use HTTP (IP, TCP, etc.) . CORS Hacks &#9989; . 1. Explain what CORS is and what it stands for . CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It&#39;s a security feature used by web browsers that prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original page. If a website wants to make a request to a different domain, the domain that is being accessed must explicitly allow it by sending special headers in the response. CORS allows for controlled access to web resources that would otherwise be restricted. . 2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites To implement CORS in your website, you need to configure your server to include specific headers in the response that indicate which origins are allowed to access your resources. The most important header is the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which specifies the domain(s) that are allowed to make requests to your server. You can also use other headers to allow specific HTTP methods or headers. . 3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites . You would want to implement CORS in your own website if you need to make requests to a different domain to access resources like APIs or to embed content from other websites. . 4. How could use CORS to benefit yourself in the future? . If you plan on developing websites that need to interact with resources on other domains (such as APIs or embedded content), implementing CORS can help you avoid security issues and access those resources safely. It can also help you provide a better user experience by allowing your website to communicate with other websites and services seamlessly. . KASM Hacks &#9989; . 1. What is the purpose of &quot;sudo&quot; when running commands in terminal? . The &quot;sudo&quot; command stands for &quot;superuser do&quot; and it allows users to run commands with administrative privileges in the terminal. When a command is run with sudo, it temporarily grants the user administrative access, giving them the ability to perform tasks that require special permissions, such as installing software or modifying system files. . 2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as? . Some commands to look at how a machine&#39;s storage is set up include &quot;df&quot; to see the amount of disk space avaliable on the file system, &quot;du&quot; to estimate file space usage, and &quot;mount&quot; to see what file systems are currently being used. . 3. What do you think are some alternatives to running &quot;curl -O&quot; to get the zip file for KASM? . A web browser, a download manager app, or a different command-line tool like &quot;wget&quot;. . 4. What kind of commands do you think the &quot;install.sh&quot; command has and why is it necessary to call it? . &quot;install.sh&quot; is a command that installs and configures the KASM software on your computer. It is necessary because it contains the necessary commands to install software or packages and automates the installation process, making it easier and more efficient for users. . 5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide. . To deploy KASM, a container-based streaming service, various elements such as headers, NGINX, load balancing, configuration, DNS, and CORS are essential. Headers are significant to configure security settings and enable CORS for KASM, while NGINX functions as a reverse proxy to manage incoming web traffic. Load balancing is necessary to distribute traffic equally among several server instances running KASM. Configuration is required to configure the KASM service and determine the specific environment settings. Finally, DNS is used to map the KASM domain name to its IP address, so users can access the service through a web browser. .",

In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # Q: What do you notice in the output? # A: Outputs only once of every number in the list, no duplicates (2 and 1) # Q: Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # A: Sets allow you to quickly and efficiently access data with no duplicates . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "Intro . Failures don’t define you | CS degree very versatile, can apply to any field (Mr. Mort concurs 🔥) | My thoughts: I really liked how Ashley opened up the presentation talking about her failures and show despite them she was able to ultimately succeed as a researcher about to start her PhD at USD. For me personally I have a big fear of failure so when I don’t preform up to my expectations I question my skill and smartness. Hearing from a graduate student pursuing a rigorous academic field in Physics really set me more at ease knowing I don’t have to be perfect to succeed in academics too. I also definitely agree with how they stressed that CS is very versatile. This is one of the main reasons I want to pursue Computer Science. I have always loved math, physics, and biology so knowing that I can apply my programming skills to industries that work with these life/physical sciences makes me hopefuly that once I graduate with a degree I have the freedom to choose what niche to work in. | . ABOUT Cal State San Marcos . National leader in social mobility - highest turnover from college to career | Internships with local industries, so much opportunity in SD | 250 stairs wow! | Small school advantage → create and change classes to tailor to students | Cal State support system very good. Smaller campus, get to know faculty system well | My thoughts: Very cool that they are the NATIONAL leader in social mobility. I feel like one of the top purposes of a college is to prepare the student for life and careers AFTER college. I also appreciate the fact that they are a small campus which means smaller faculty to student ratio and a better support system. This is a very important factor that I look for in ideal colleges. | . Pathways . Chemistry | BioChem | Chemical engineering education | Applied Physics | Biological science | Computer Science, Computer Informations System, CyberSecurity, Computer Engineering | Applied mathematics, Algorithm Design | Software/Electrical Engineering | Mechnical Engineering | My thoughts: I am personally most interested in the Computer Science topics specifically machine learning and artifiical intelligence in the applications of robotics and analyzing biological data. I also have always loved math because of its logical thinking so I’m considered a minor in applied mathematics where I can dive into Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and more. | . CSUSM Clubs . Cybersecurity | Robotics | 3D printing | Women in STEM | Society of Women Engineers | Society of Physics students | National Society of Black Engineers | oSTEM -My thoughts: The Robotics and 3D printing clubs sound cool! I’m currently on a First Tech Challenge robotics team so I’m excited that I can continue with these extracurriculars in college. | . Internships . Can span from 4 weeks → 2 years | How to find internships (Campus events, Check emails, Google, Networking, Join Clubs) | Tips: Avoid unpaid, should get paid for dedication, Apply even if feel underqualified, Ask faculty members for help | My thoughts: Ashley gave some really good insights about internships. I didn’t know they could be elongated for that long of a time period. Currently the main way I have looked for internships is my emailing professors at local colleges like UCSD so it was nice to hear more ways I can look for them. | . Programs . Summer Scholars Program → full time paid $6000 | Quantum Bridge Program (admitted Cal Sate San Marcos) - learn about quantum info → paid $150 | . Research . Quantum | Meteor | Microplastics | Artihmetic Dyanmics in Math | Virtual Reality labs | Artificial intelligence My thoughts: I find the research in Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality very intriguing. I want to work on using machine learning algorithms like reinforcement or reward-based learning to train autonomous vehicles and optimize their speed and safety. Virtual Reality just sounds really cool because its like an intersection of computer science, art, and design and I like making these look aesthetic and appear on a screen. | . | Paying for College . Grant (goverment funding) vs Scholarship (privately funded) | Grants look at demographic status, grades, how much your parent’s make | Loans Subsidized: partially funded by government, prevent from deeper into debts | Unsubsidized: paying more than loan right after grace period | | Financial aid office website for CS specifically for loan/scholarship | John is Debt-free college student! Accomplishment! 💰 | My thoughts: I have never really known the difference between grants and scholarships so I’m glad I know the difference now. I didn’t know that debt could be that bad so I definitely need to look into that before I apply to colleges and take that into consideration. I really admire how John took the step to attend community college first and then transfer to Cal State! Debt-free woohoooo! | . Life after college . Private or public institution | Military, general autonomics | Internship at safari park (John) | Biomedical and environmental field | Teaching credential program | Graduate program → you get paid !! | Go to PhD. should not pay a dime | My thoughts: It was nice to get an insight of different career pathways after college. I think that I will either pursue a PhD if I like research or find a software engineering job in tech industry. One of my dreams it to work for Apple as a iOS developer since recently I’ve gotten some experienced in using Xcode to make and publish an app. I used the Storyboard to design the screens on the frontend and coded in Swift to integrate the backend so each button has a function. | . Bristle Bot activity . It was very fun to build a bristlebot from scratch. I didn’t know you could actually make this contraption out of a toothbrush head, batteries, tape, and whatnot. Grace and I were inspired by this hands-on engineering activity that Ashley was so kind to give us some of their supplies so we can use the same activity with the robotics class we are teaching on Friday!! Yippee!! . Overall Reflection + Connection to AP CSP . Overall, I really gained some valuable insights from Ashley and John’s visit from Cal State. I know now that I don’t have to get the perfect exam scores to succeed in the field I want to pursue (Computer science/Data Science). What matters is that I do my best to thoroughly understand the material I am given and do my best to apply it to my daily life. Especially since I am a rising senior and now is the time where I have to think about what major I want to pursue, what colleges I want to go to, and my future career goals, this talk was helpful for me to realize that my niche interests in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are support by clubs, research areas, and classes at colleges like CSUSM. Further, a big take away is that where you start does not define where you finish. My path will not be the same as anyone else in the room and no matter if I go to community college, a university, or pursue an internship I will just focus on learning more and more about what I am interested in. Connecting this to the AP CSP course at Del Norte. I’m going to start approaching hacks not as just an assignment I try to perfect, but as learning opportunities for me to dive deep into the topic we are learning and maybe do some extra exploration in how it applies to the topics I’m interested in. .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. It is also usually expressed using big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the amount of memory used by the algorithm as the size of the input increases. . Big O Notation . Constant Time O(1) | Linear Time O(n) | Quadratic Time O(n^2) | Logarithmic Time O(logn) | Exponential time (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) . Constant Time O(1) . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) . Linear Time O(n) . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Quadratic Time O(n^2) . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Logarithmic Time O(logn) . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . import time def constant_time(numbers, target): print(numbers[target]) start_time = time.time() constant_time(numbers, 263) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 263 Time taken: 0.00010228157043457031 seconds .",

Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . A database schema is a blueprint that defines the structure of a database. It describes the organization and interrelationships among the various data elements or tables that make up the database. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | . The purpose of an identity column is to provide a unique identifier for each row in the table, without requiring the user to manually specify a value for that column. . What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | . A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. .

A connection object is an object that represents a connection to a database. It is used to establish and manage a connection to a database and allows the programmer to execute commands and retrieve data from the database. . Same for cursor object? | . A cursor object is an object that provides a way to iterate over the rows of a result set returned by a SQL query. It allows the programmer to fetch data from a database row by row, and perform operations on each row as it is retrieved. . Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | . The attributes that are in the conn object include special variables, function variables, class variables, in_transaction, isolation_level, row_factory, and total_changes. The attributes taht are in the cursor object include special variables, function variables, arraysize, connection, description, lastrowid, row_factory, and rowcount. . Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . Yes it is an object because it is set equal to cursor.execute() . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | . In the create function of 2.4a the function uses SQLite database to take in the data that the user inputs to create the new users. The create function of 2.4b uses SQLAlchemy to create the new users. 2.4a function can be better used for more simple projects where as 2.4b function can be used for more complex projects. . Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . The SQL INSERT statement is used to insert new rows or records into a database table. The User init method is used to create a new user record in the database. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | . Checks to make sure the length of the new password is at least 2 characters. If it is not then the code presumes that they were hacked . Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . Try/except is used for the errors that could occur. Except would occur if there is an error that did not pass through the try block of code. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . Try/except is repeated. This is repeated because there are many different places where checking to ensure everything is inputted correctly is necessary. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | . DELETE can be dangerous in the case that you delete all of your data and do not have it anywhere else. . What is the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} do? | . f is used to embed expressions inside of string literals. The {uid} is used to input the user id that is being used in the code. . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | . The menu repeats because it is recursive. . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . Yes you could make it a list with c, r, u, d, s . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. . In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? Yes, each function is an example of procedural abstraction. You can call these functions later in the program to execute a segment of code. One example is the &quot;create&quot; function, when called, this function passes in data for a new row in the data table and uses sqlite to add the data to the users table. | . | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture. Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. Data abstraction is all over this program, each function of CRUD interacts with data, one example is the &quot;create&quot; function. This example shows me debugging the create function, I have a breakpoint right where the function adds the data I just inputted to the data table. | . | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. | . Object Orientation vs Imperative . Object-oriented programming (OOP) and imperative programming are both popular programming paradigms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some key differences between the two: . Focus: Imperative programming focuses on how to achieve a specific task, while OOP focuses on the creation and manipulation of objects. . | Data Structures: In imperative programming, data structures are often simple arrays or structures, while in OOP, they are typically more complex objects with their own attributes and methods. . | Inheritance: In OOP, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, allowing for code reuse and increased modularity. In imperative programming, code is often duplicated or reused by copying and pasting. . | . Overall, OOP is often seen as more organized, modular, and reusable than imperative programming. However, imperative programming can be more efficient for certain tasks, particularly those that involve a lot of low-level manipulation of data. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the programmer. . &quot;&quot;&quot; These imports define the key objects &quot;&quot;&quot; from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy &quot;&quot;&quot; These object and definitions are used throughout the Jupyter Notebook. &quot;&quot;&quot; # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///files/sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) &quot;&quot;&quot; database dependencies to support sqlite examples &quot;&quot;&quot; import datetime from datetime import datetime import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash &#39;&#39;&#39; Tutorial: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#tutorials, try to get into a Python shell and follow along &#39;&#39;&#39; # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table # -- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the key concept of SQLAlchemy # -- a.) db.Model is like an inner layer of the onion in ORM # -- b.)

Repeat until reach gray square: If (can_moveForward) Move_Forward Else (can_moveRight) { Rotate_Right Move_Forward } . (4) Make a binary search tree of different the list [1,2,3,4,6,9,11,69] . See image in issue . (5) Explain thorughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) . To find 69 using sequential search, the list would be iterated 7 times. Using a binary search instead, this process would be much more efficient. The search would start from the middle index, then going to the first and last index and dividing by two. This process goes through until the number 69 is found. . (6) Make a diagram explaining how you found the list (not tree, include equation) . see image in issue . (7) Put this list of strings in a order that can be used for binary search [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . (8) Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is quicker than sequential search because binary search takes out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut. . (9) [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . I would be searching for 36. First, I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and since 16 &lt; 36, I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36. . See issue for image . SUMMARY . Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. | Sequential Search (Inefficient search): compare each number to the number you want to find until you get to the number you want to find | Binary Search (Efficient search): repeats the process of finding a median and evaluating | Boolean Expressions: expression that evaluates to either true or false | Truth Tables: displays the logical operations on input signals in a table format, identifies all possible input combinations and the output for each | .",

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size .

Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | . ls, cd, pwd . What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? | . dir. ren, chdir . What are some of the major differences? | . Windows vs Linux :directory listing (Windows - dir, Linux - ls), rename a file (Windows - ren, Linux - mv), returns current directory location (Windows - chdir, Linux - pwd), both change to current directory is cd Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? | . It helps to identify the location of the image file on a computer or server so that you can open, edit, and display it. A path includes the name of the directory/folder and anysubdirectories or subfolders that the file is located in. This information is important because it helps to locate the image file and retrieve it when needed. . How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | . Unit 5 is where students learn about the development of computer programs that process and analyze data. This includes working with text, images, and video, and understanding how to access and manipulate that data. When it comes to images, metadata refers to the information embedded in an image file, like the date/time the image was taken, the camera settings used to capture the image, and the location where the image was taken. This data can be accessed and analyzed using programming techniques. Labeling is when you assign descriptive tags/labels to images to help identify and classify them. This is typically used in ML and AI where image recognition can classify and identity different objects. Like a robot being able to tell the difference between a cat and a dog. . Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? | . IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing. It is now known as Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a preferable platform for pandas and images because it is a way to put data, code, visualizations, and documentation all in one single notebook. You can store massive amounts of metadata from images and format it into pandas dataframe to later change it . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Emma Shen&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smileyface.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS. . How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? | . Binary is most basic representation of data using only 0 and 1 to represent each bit of information while Hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system that uses 16 digits (0-9 and A-f) to represent a byte of information. They are both numerical systems to represent data in computers. However, Base64 is a method for encoding binary data using 64 characters that are safe for use in email and other text-based communication channels. It has the most variety in being able to store numbers, letters, characters, AND symbols. It works by breaking the input data into blocks of three bytes, and then encoding each block as four characters from a pre-defined set of 64 characters. The resulting encoded text can then be sent as ASCII text. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64: | . emm --&gt; ZW1t . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . I see buffering/loading screens everywhere on my phone and computer. To make up for loading time and to process the input and prepare for display of output, buffering screens are important to keep user entertained and know that request is still processing. Below are two ways that Synergy StudentVue uses buffering . . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | . The more data is being loaded the longer the buffer is . How do these effects apply to images? | . Larger images take more time to load. For lossy files they take a short time because the image is compressed to load faster while for lossless files they save original data and preserve the quality which causes it to load for longer time . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Manipulate images to different colors / filters . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | . Yes like imperative programming sequence . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Initialize a new image object with the same dimensions as the input image. | For each pixel in the input image:a. Retrieve the red, green, and blue values of the pixel. b. Calculate the average of the red, green, and blue values. c. Set the red, green, and blue values of the pixel in the new image object to the average value. | Return the new image object.&lt;/b&gt; | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? --&gt; | . Scaling an image means changing its size, either making it larger or smaller. When an image is scaled, each pixel in the image is adjusted to a new position and/or color value, in order to create a new image with the desired size.&lt;/p&gt; Before scaling, each pixel in the original image has a specific position (x,y) and color value (RGB). . After scaling, the position and color value of each pixel in the scaled image will be different from its position and color value in the original image. &lt;/b&gt; . Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? --&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Scaling an image can be considered a type of compression, as it reduces the amount of data required to represent the image by changing its size. . For College Board AP CSP, it describes compression as &quot;reducing the number of bits used to represent data in a file.&quot; This usually involves using techniques such as lossless compression algorithms, which exploit redundancy in the data to reduce its size without losing any information, or lossy compression algorithms, which selectively discard some information in order to achieve greater compression. . Scaling an image, on the other hand, only changes the size and resolution of the image, without necessarily reducing the number of bits used to represent the data in the file. &lt;/b&gt; . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Emma Shen&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;pretty&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;mountain.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- pretty Emma Shen PNG RGB Original size: (1048, 796) Scaled size: (320, 243) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

Hacks!!! . 1. College Board Practice . Data Compression Quiz 3/3 . Extracting info from Data Quiz 5/6 . 5 Mistake . Explanation: The data is determined only by image recognition by a camera. Thus, the number of bicyles passed on a particular day can be recorded (Answer Choice D). However, the calculation of a AVERAGE speed would need metadata that includes the cars distance and time. . Using Programs with Data Quiz 5/6 . 4 Mistake . Explanation: The key to these types of questions is that I need to select TWO correct answers. Here, I chose Answer C which is wrong because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. I should&#39;ve chosen Answer D instead because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. . Binary Quiz . 2. Lossy vs Lossless Image . Lossless - compression in which the image is reduced without any quality loss Ex. A logo that can be produced in multiple places in the website and sizes | . Lossy - a process that removes some of the data from your image file, reducing the overall file size. This process is irreversible, meaning that the file information will be removed permanently. | Ex. Sending an image file to your friend over email and it asks you whether you want to send as small, medium, large, or actual size. In this situation, you can reduce the size/quality of the picture to make the file send faster. . . 3. Programming paradigm . Numpy, manipulating pixels. As opposed to Grey Scale treatment, pick a couple of other types like red scale, green scale, or blue scale. We want you to be manipulating pixels in the image. . | Binary and Hexadecimal reports.

When people login to a site on our website, their information includes their name and their email. . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I think PIIs have the potential to be dangerous because people are able to stalk you online and I don’t want to be stalked. However, PII’s are necessary for login and user experience so it is important to be sure that the information you are giving is to a secure website where your information will not be stolen. . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. A good password is one that can not be guessed by other people and does not include any personal information. | A bad password is 1234567890 or something that can be easily guessed. | . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. -Symmetric Encryption: Method of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption; is fast and efficient (SECRET KEY) - Asymmetric Encryption: encryption that uses two different keys for encryption and decryption. The public key, is used for encrypting the data and shared widely, and the private key, is used for decrypting the data and must be kept confidential. . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.

CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? A crowdsource idea relates to a project I am working on right now. I am developing this app with my friend called Grow &amp; Give. | . | Here is a little exerpt about it: Student productivity has plummeted following the COVID-19 pandemic. Nationwide test scores, specifically California, are at an all-time low which signal lower engagement and morale among elementary to high school students. A reason for this decrease in academic performance is the fact that children have difficulties taking the time to plan a goal, start their task, and take needed breaks in between. Thus, our app aims to guide them through this journey and give them the incentive to convert their productive minutes to in-game coins which will accumulate to donate money to support real-world causes such as planting a tree, taking a pound of trash from the ocean, and providing educational and academic materials to underserved kids. In this way, we are not only building focused intelligent minds, but also setting a strong moral foundation for children to build off of as they grow up to contribute social good to their community and workplace . It was just recently published to the app store, and we want to test its effectiveness using a week-long study. In this experiment, we want as many elementary to highschool students from different ethnicities and backgrounds to use our app for 7 consecutive days. We can crowdsource by mentioning on announcements that is to all students and sent out mass survey form to get people to sign up and input their email. . Here is a picture where we demoed our app at Design 39 2/3/2023 where we attempted to crowdsource by getting the students interested in our study and leaving their email so we can do mass testing . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Our project is better with crowdsourcing to gain more accurate functionality for a certain target audience. For example, since our project is aimed to teenagers who want to improve their skin care we can send survey and get info about their routine now and what they feel like they are missing in taking care of their skin. | . | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. Some data we can collect for our CPT project is before they use our website how they feel about their skin then and how they want it to improve, then after they use our website how useful they found it | 5.3 Computer Bias . Intentional bias: Ex. Tiktok: based on your view time, which videos you like and comment → recommends you more content and tiktokers similar to what you have liked before → pushes you to believe and identify in specific niche → increases interaction time which is what Tiktok wants . Unintentional bias Ex. One recent story takes place in 2019 when Optum, a health services algorithm that predicts which patients benefit most from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental prejudice against black patients. The algorithm used how much money a patient spends on healthcare as a measure of how healthy they are; however, since black patients face disproportionate levels of poverty and often spend less on health care than whites, the algorithm falsely concluded that blacks were healthier than equally sick white patients → discriminatory-based system unfairly reduced healthcare funding for black patients, putting their well-being at risk. . Algorithms that affect my decisions Rotten tomato ratings affect what movies people choose to watch Amazon: After you buy a product, it shows you what other people have bought with that product → prompt consumerism → makes people buy more things that they haven’t wouldn’t have in the first place . Virtual assistants have female voices Sexism - believe women are meant to assist others. They are the “soothing” voice that will help you with all your needs . HP computers are racist Probably based algorithm off of only white faces (not diverse data set) Did not train algorithms to account for darker faces Either disregarded darker faces when testing product / ignored the fact cannot detect → either way is intentional bias . For our CPT project I will make sure to prevent any kind of bias. We will do this by using wide diverse data set that considers all different skin products for various skin types and tones. . 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? The top course of action that would empower someone in the digital world is getting access to a piece of technology to become familiar with the internet. In this way they can develop digital literacy skills and learn to navigate technology and understand the risks and benefits. Further, with easy access to any topic they want at their fingertips, they can continuously learn and stay informed about digital developments. They can also take advantage of mass networking platforms that allow people to create a positive online presence and connect with those they otherwise would’ve never been able to conctact . | How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. “Someone who is empowered” can be interpreted in many ways. It could be someone who is more knowledgable in a certain area, in a higher economic stance, or just more confident in theirself and identity. In addressing this broad definition, here are a few ways you can empower someone who is inferior to you in some aspect: Share knowledge and skills. | Be a mentor or coach. | Advocate for digital equality and accessibility. | Collaborate on digital projects. | Support and uplift underrepresented communities online Specifically at Del Norte, you can become a WHAT tutor to help underclassmen in their essay writing, or volunteer at the nighthawk tutoring session where you can tutor students all different subjects that you are interested in. Further, clubs like National Honor Society are a great way to give back to your community and help underserved communities in their basic needs and education. | . | Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? A main barrier at Del Norte is the financial barrier. Not all families are able to afford a personal computer for their children. Some ways we can raise awareness and help these people are: Providing digital literacy training and education. | Partner with community organizations to bridge the digital divide. | Advocate for government policies that support digital access for all. | Create and support public spaces with technology access, such as community centers or libraries. | Collaborate with technology companies to donate equipment and support digital access initiatives. | . | 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing | Benefits . Computing allows us to create technological devices that make our lives easier. For example, just one device, the iPhone, has revolutionized communication, safety, and access to knowledge. With good service and wifi, we can contact anyone we want from wherever we want. In times of danger if we feel unsafe we can call 911 which will send help our way in the matter of seconds. If we want to learn how to cook a meal, what the cube root is of 64, and why fruit is good for you, the phone is a mobile device that makes it possible for us to access the answers to these questions anywhere. | Computing can analyze and categorize mass data at a speed and accuracy that humans cannot. The applications of AI have taken over from the health to the transportation industry.For example, there is computer software designed to help screen for cancers. Computers can scan through millions of possible signs of cancer and give a positive or negative result in less than a few minutes. Scientists are also using computers to help invent new methods of curing diseases with protein sequence pattern matching. | Innovative computer software can help those who are disadvantaged or have physical disabilities. For example, Stephen Hawking used a computer to speak, which wouldn’t be as easy without a computer. Computers are also great tools for the blind; special software (screen reader), can read what is on the screen. Computers and computer-controlled devices help increase a better quality of life for many different types of people. | . Harms . A clear harm of computing is that when technology makes our life easier, our brains are getting dumber. ChatGPT is a prime example. While it is a very useful for students to get answers to their questions who is good temporarily to get homework done, it is negative long-term when the student needs to recall this information on a test. | While machine learning and data mining have greatly benefitted many fields, their findings are also susceptible to biases and may unintentionally contribute to discrimination. One recent story takes place in 2019 when Optum, a health services algorithm that predicts which patients benefit most from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental prejudice against black patients. The algorithm used how much money a patient spends on healthcare as a measure of how healthy they are; however, since black patients face disproportionate levels of poverty and often spend less on health care than whites, the algorithm falsely concluded that blacks were healthier than equally sick white patients. Here it can be seen that computing is NOT perfect. In fact, it is seen as beneath humans because it is not capable of taking into account social factors such as race. | Replacement of humans by computing innovations, leading to the loss of previously existing jobs and economic hardship for the now-unemployed workers | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? | I believe that dopamine issues caused by overuse of technology is true. Social media and video games are designed to make you addicted to checking and playing them. Spending so much time recieving “short-term” pleasure from playing games on your computer will decrease your joy in other ordinary actions that usually bring you dopamine such as exericising. For me personally, I have found it harder to get out of bed and find joy in the small things when I spend multiple hours a day just staring at a screen. .",

Testing | 0 | 0 | Did not describe any of the calls and did not ue any arguments that use paramters. | . My Score: 5/6 College Board Score: 5/6 . Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard? . This one was very easy to grade because it had everything perfectly until the Testing requiremnt where they did it so poorly that it was easy to take away that point. | . Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard . For the testing category I feel that that barely even looked at the requirements and described none of the calls, and just the code themselves which is obviously not what college board asked to. Overall a great project but it could have been perfect if they paid more attention to the last requirement. | . Overall Reflection: . Overall, these college board scoring assingments were extremely beneficial in teaching me how to get a great score on my own CPT project. Prior to these assignemtns, I barely knew what one of these projects were supposed to look like, but now I have a great perspective and many ideas of what I can do to make my one. This assigment especially taught me all the ways to meet colllegeboards requirements, such as the extreme detail that is needed in explainations of certain things like functionality vs contribution to program. Additionally paying close details to the requirements is going to be extremely important, because one small slip up will lose an entire point. FInally, comparing the best and the worst projects really gave me a perspective on how I am going to do my own project and how I will be going above and beyond in order to ensure the perfection of my own CPT. | .",

            "content": "Ceramics 🍶🏺⚱ . . I really enjoyed the artwork from the ceramics students. While when I think of the word “art” I usually think of sketches, paintings, and more stereotypical art forms, it is important to recognize and appreciate mediums such as forming unique figures made of clay and hardening them into practical and artistic objects. The students made a variety of structures such as teapots, statues, plates, cups, and more. They all had their own color theme and ideas. A few of my personal favorites was a tea cup that was in the shape of a turtle and the body was in the texture of a turtle’s shell, a cup that had a simple but elegant look with vines growing around the surface, and snakes that curled around a cup that looked like it was for when you brush your teeth and need to wash your mouth with water. However, my favorite favorite was this art piece: . . Although the first time I laid eyes on it I physically flinched, the more I looked at the more I was in awe of how realistically gory and perfectly crafted it was. The most prominent aspect was the way the bat was able to balance and not fall over while being “stuck” in the human’s mouth. The person’s facial expression also just speaks to me in the way that they seeem surprised and eerie at the same time. Makes me think whether this person is forced to eat the bat or not. Anyways, just wanted to share this one with y’all. . Drawing &amp; Painting🎨🖌️🖼️ . . When I was first browsing this painting I felt an indescribable sense of warmth. For me, I saw my grandmother and grandfather feeding me authentic chinese dishes made with love. The last time I went to my family’s hometown was 6 years ago. It’s been too long and this image brings me back to the qing zheng yu which means natural fish in Chinese that was my favorite dish. I can see my grandmother’s enthusiastic smile and chopstick feeding me noodles and my grandfather’s wholesome eye smile as he drinks his soup. I feel at home here. . I&#39;m not sure what class this was ◡̈ . . Here is just a cute little selfie pic of Sanika, Ishi, and I posing next to these photos of skin care products because we are CSP!!! Customized Skin Products!! . AP Computer Science A 💻 . One project I really liked in Mort’s room was one where any student at DNHS can submit their club to be on a master sheet and other students can leave their reviews of the clubs. I think that this is a website needed at our school and would organize information very nicely and be very helpful for people looking to join activities they are interested in. Having an alumni review of what the club is like and what they gained from it is very cool! . .",

See image in issue . (5) Explain thorughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) . To find 69 using sequential search, the list would be iterated 7 times. Using a binary search instead, this process would be much more efficient. The search would start from the middle index, then going to the first and last index and dividing by two. This process goes through until the number 69 is found. . (6) Make a diagram explaining how you found the list (not tree, include equation) . see image in issue . (7) Put this list of strings in a order that can be used for binary search [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . (8) Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is quicker than sequential search because binary search takes out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut. . (9) [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . I would be searching for 36. First, I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and since 16 &lt; 36, I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36. . See issue for image . SUMMARY . Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. | Sequential Search (Inefficient search): compare each number to the number you want to find until you get to the number you want to find | Binary Search (Efficient search): repeats the process of finding a median and evaluating | Boolean Expressions: expression that evaluates to either true or false | Truth Tables: displays the logical operations on input signals in a table format, identifies all possible input combinations and the output for each | .",

            "content": "Unit 2: Binary/Data Terms . Bits: A bit or a binary digit, is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit can be one of 2 physical states, such as either 0 or 1, yes or no, and true or false. . Bytes: A byte is a unit of data that is eight bits long. It is used by computers to represent a character such as a letter or number symbol. . Hexadecimal: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. There are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. . Binary Numbers . Unsigned Integer: Numbers without + or - sign, only representing the magnitude not the direction. Used when we know that the value we are storing will always be non-negative . Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4 . Signed Integer: The default where the variable can hold positive or negative numbers . Ex. -1, 6, -29, 1000 . Floating Point: Positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. Used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts . Ex. 1.23, 87.425, and -9039454.2, NOT 101, -3, 18203 . Binary Data Abstractions: . Boolean: Variable type that represents one of two values: True or False. . A = 200 . B = 33 . If b &gt; a: . print(“b is greater than a”) . If a &gt; b: . print(“a is greater than b”) . ASCII: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII was first created when all people wanted computers to be able to show was numbers, letters, punctuation, and non-printing commands(Enter, Delete, F1).. All ASCII encoded character can be represented by 1 byte, or 8 bits for a total of 2^8 = 127 different total characters. . Ex. lowercase “h” character → 104 (D) → 01101000(B) . Unicode: today, people use emojis and new symbols like other languages and stuff and computers needed to be able to represent all that. Unicode is a new standard defining an association between characters and even more numbers. Each unicode character (utf8) is 4 bytes, or 32 bits, enough for 2^32 different characters. Most modern programming languages represent strings as utf8 encoded characters (hex) because people use these new symbols in their code, but old languages like C still associat either character type with a single byte integer . Ex. “Hello” → U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F . RGB: RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display.These 3 colors can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. . Ex. rgb(255, 0, 0) = red because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0. . Data Compression . Lossy: a techinique that reduces file size by discarding less important information . Lossless (unit 3): Every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored. . Unit 3: Algorithms Binary/Data Terms . Variables:An abstraction inside a program that holds a specific value or meaning defined by the programmer. . Data Types: . Integer- highScore (involves math, save as integer or numbers) . String- firstName (name is text, so it is a string) . Boolean- isSunny (2 options, true or false) . String- phoneNumber (no math, just numbers) . Arithmetic Operators . Plus indicated addition (a + b) . Minus indicates subtractions (a - b) . Asterisk indicated multiplication (a * b) . Slash indicated division (a / b) . Managing Complexity with Variables . Lists: Allows you to complete a process for each value in the list, or store multiple values to one variable. . 2D Lists: Array within an array. You can pull single arrays through using index and variable commands. . Ex: T = [[11, 12, 5, 2], [15, 6,10], [10, 8, 12, 5], [12,15,8,6]] . Dictionaries: Allows the storage or data keys and values (assigning a certain piece of data to fit the category it is assigned) . Class: A particular data structure. . Algorithms: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. . Sequence: A specific order a process is completed, which impacts the output. . Selection: Programmer decides between 2 different functions . Iteration: Repetition of a process . For loop: repeats a section of code a set number of times . While loop: repearts a section of code an unknown number of times, until the code is told to break . Expressions: A piece of syntax in coding . Comparison Operators . Operators used in programming languages which compare two different values. These can often be used to set up statements which return a boolean value (true/false), which can be stored in variables. All examples below are in Python and were checked using the bool() command, which returns the True/False output. . == : checks if 2 values are equal to each other (ex. “Hrar?” == “Hrar?” OR 1 == 1.0) . !=: checks if 2 values are NOT equal to each other . &lt;, &lt;=, =&gt;, &gt;: checks if left value is less than (and equal to) or greater than (and equal to) the right value . in/not in : Checks if the specified value is an element in the specified list. in returns true if the element is in the list; not in returns true if the element is not in the list. (Ex. List = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, “hi”]) . 1 in List . 3 in List . 5 in List . “hi” in List . “What” not in List . “Why” not in List . 2 in List . 4 in List . 6 in List . 9 not in List . 7 not in List . “Weird” in List . Booleans Expressions and Selection . The value of a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (often known as if statements). The condition of the if statement is the boolean variable; if its value is True, the condition passes. A possible function of this is in Python code below . //Assume the grade was calculated by a computer program . //The bool command is here to make a boolean variable . //In a larger computer program, the value was likely . //generated by previous commands . Grade = 89.49 . isA = bool(Grade &gt;= 90) . if isA: . print(“Yay!”) . else: . print(“hmm”) . OUTPUT: hmm . Booleans Expressions and Iteration . Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met (ex: an assignment is submitted) . Here’s some informal python code: . num = 10 . correct = bool(num &gt; 0) . while correct: . print(num) num = num - 1 correct = bool(num &gt; 0) . OUTPUT: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 . Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator (ex: AND, OR, XOR) containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator. . AND TABLE: All inputs must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Input 3 . False | False | False | . False | True | False | . True | False | False | . True | True | True | . . OR TABLE: At least one input must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Input 3 . False | False | False | . False | True | True | . True | False | True | . True | True | True | . . XOR TABLE: Exactly one input must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Input 3 . False | False | False | . False | True | True | . True | False | True | . True | True | False | . . Characters . The units which make up a string. These can be letters, numbers, special symbols (!@#$%^&amp;*), or even spaces. Regardless, if one types, each keystroke outputs one character. . Ex: “keyboard hi!!!” has 14 characters: 10 letters, three exclamation marks, and a space. . Strings . A variable data type which consists of a combination of letters, numbers, and other special characters (ex: @#$%^&amp;*). They are seen inside quotation marks, and operators cannot affect any numbers in the string. . Ex: stringVar = “Hello World!” . “Hello World!” is a string. . Length . The number of elements in a list. Here’s an example in Python: . numList = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1] . This list has a length of 17 because it has 17 elements. Each element is separated by a comma. . Concatenation: the act of joining two strings into a single string. Often, these strings are printed to an output terminal/console. Here’s an example in pseudocode: . concat(“tri”, “llion”) . This concatenates the strings “tri” and “llion”, making a new string “trillion”. . Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings . The first two (upper and lower) seem to be referring to Python methods. They are quite simple. I think it would be easiest to explain with a demonstration: . String = “WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS” . print(string) . print(string.upper()) . print(string.lower()) . Output: . WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS . WHYAREWEDOINGTHIS . whyarewedoingthis . Relatively intuitive. The upper() method changes all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase, while the lower() method does the opposite. A potential reason for this would be ensuring uniform case (especially of uppercase when making important headings like page/screen titles) Traversing strings behaves highly similar to iterating elements in a list, except that instead of iterating through a list, it’s a string. Elements in a list are now the characters of a string. A potential application of this could be to search all strings for a specific substring. Here’s some example python code: . #Very informative example here: #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-characters-of-a-string-in-python/ . String = “Thirty Trillion Dollars” . for i in String: . if i == “T” print(“T detected!”) . Output: . T detected! . T detected! . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; . Python if statements execute associated lines of code if the if condition is satisfied. . If the if condition is not satisfied, an Elif statement is executed as fallback… with another condition and associated commands . If all associated Elif conditions are not satisfied, there can be an else statement which unconditionally executes associated commands. . Ex: input = input(“enter a string”) . if input == “Hi”: . print(“Hello World!”) . print(“How are you doing today?”) . elif input == “Why”: . print(“That’s a good question to ask about everything that happens.”) . elif input == “Who are you”: . print(“I’m an anonymous guest. Pleased to meet you.”) . else: . print(“Have a great day!”) . This code uses if statements and elif statements to return strings for three special inputs (“Hi,” “Why,” “Who are you”). If the input were any of those strings, the associated command would be executed. Otherwise, the command associated with the else statement (which prints “Have a great day!”) would be executed. . Nested Selection Statements: When a program can choose from many paths to lead to a result, think of flowcharts where one condition must be satisfied before another can be picked Python For/While loops with Range with List: There are two ways loops can be used one is with a range and the other is with a list. When using the range method a variable is iterated a set number of times based on the range (typically an integer value), while with the list method the loop is iterated based on the length of a list. . Range: . i = 0 . while i &lt; 5: . print(i + 1) i += 1 . Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . List: . list = [“a”, “b”, “c”] . i = 0 . while i&lt;len(list): . print(list[i]) i = i + 1 . Output: a, b, c . Combining loops with conditionals to Break: Makes it so that the loop will stop as soon as a condition is met . Continue: A statement used in while and for loops which starts the code from the beginning, in the image below you can see how the “h” in “Python” was not printed since the continue statement skipped the print(letter) and made the code start from the beginning . for letter in “python”: . if letter == “n”: continue print(letter) . Output: pytho . Procedural Abstraction: A model of what the code should do but it doen’t tell how to do it. It’s basically using a procedure to name the idea. . Python Def: It defines a function and makes code simpler by allowing for the code in the function to be called . Procedures: Code that doesn’t return a value but allows for a specific task to be completed . Parameters: Values that are passed into functions when they are defined in addition(a + b), a and b will be given a value and that value is a parameter . Return Values: Values that are outputed when a function is completed. An example of this was when we were using console.log(“message”) when testing in AppLab .",

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid white;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em blue;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Multiple cells are used to setup HTML in this lesson. Many of the JavaScript cells will use the output tag(s) to write into the HTML that has been setup. . %%html is used to setup HTML code block | &quot;style&quot; tag enables visuals customization | &quot;div&quot; tag is setup to receive data | . %%html &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; #output { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;output&quot;&gt; Hello! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . . Hello! . output explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: &quot;Hello, World!&quot; . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view element.text(msg); //alert(msg); . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function... There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: output * Description: The parameter is &quot;output&quot; to console and jupyter page */ function logIt(output) { console.log(output); element.append(output + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); //alert(output); } // First sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; logIt(msg); // Second sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, &lt;b&gt;Students&lt;/b&gt;!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2023-2024.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object and JSON . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. . Definition of class allows for a collection of data, the &quot;class Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of a Person. | Instance of a class, the &quot;const teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; makes an object &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;class Person&quot;. | Setting and Getting properties After creating teacher and student objects, observe that properties can be changed/muted or extracted/accessed. | . %%html &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.31.3/js/jquery.tablesorter.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;style&gt; /* CSS-style selector maps to table id or other id&#39;s in HTML */ #jsonTable, #flaskTable { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Table for writing and extracting jsonText --&gt; &lt;table id=&quot;jsonTable&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Classroom JSON Data&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;jsonText&quot;&gt;{&quot;classroom&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;object&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;ghID&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;classOf&quot;:2000,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;}]}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . .

If I were to not win a lottery, I should realize that it was up to chance and there was nothing I could do to make me win, I shouldn&#39;t spend any negative emotions on a situation I have no control over. However, when it comes to pursuing happiness, I do need to take effort to do things that bring me joy and surround myself with people I love. In this way, we won&#39;t tie our self worth to our salary, where we live, etc. because we can be content with our life in any circumstance. Vivian&#39;s takeaways . I learned that things like your salary or your job aren&#39;t what necessarily make you happy, rather data shows that people who spend more time engaging in social activities feel more happy overall. This goes along with being time affluent and avoiding burnout. Amay&#39;s takeaways . A student&#39;s life is mostly centered around learning. A student will need to show evidence of their learning in almost every lesson they attend. Concentrating on their work and employing effective study techniques are two approaches to assist students in learning. We must value our time, as Laurie Santos discussed in her address. If we value our time, we have more of it and may use it to enhance our mental health. There are various ways we may make the most of our time. For instance, we may efficiently spend our time by concentrating on our task, doing it quickly, and avoiding rushing it at the last minute. In accordance with Laurie Santos&#39;s discourse, we should also exercise self-control and develop healthy routines.When you have the opportunity to work hard and have a break from your responsibilities, you should do so. These actions would improve your academic performance as well as your general wellbeing since they would reduce the amount of homework you have to complete at home. Sarah&#39;s takeaways . From the video, I learned that small things like money and grades won&#39;t necessarily happier. An experiment showed that participating in activities like giftgiving can help make a person much happier. .",

            "content": "Creation 1: A Derivative Quiz . Press on me! . 1 Program Purpose and Function . Program Purpose: Memory of the many derivatives is essential in succeeding in Calculus. I am currently struggling to remember the derivatives after a summer of no-calculus practice, so I hope this quiz can jog my own memory and help others as well! This program is meant to be a quick and easy study tool for students aking Calculus . Functionality: This program is a three-question quiz that tests a student&#39;s capability to remember the derivatives of sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x). The app starts on the home page where a text welcomes the user to the quiz, the user presses Start Quiz to begin. Now the user must answer 3 questions. If they answer correctly, &quot;Correct Answer!&quot; text appears. If they answer correctly, &quot;Incorrect Answer&quot; text appears. Regardless if the user gets the problem correct, the screen will change to the next screen within 2 seconds. The last screen is where it gives your resuls: score out of 3. . 2 Data Abstraction . (simplifies a set of data by representing it in some general way) I used data abstraction by creating a variable called “score”. I initialized this variable to 0, and everytime the user answers a question correctly, 1 is added to the current score. In this way, I can record each user’s personal correct answer count in one variable and use it to print out their final score. . 3 Managing Complexity . ?? . 4 Procedural Abstraction . (when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters. The idea is that we have code which can cope with a variety of different situations, depending on how its parameters are set when it is called.) . 5 Algorithmn Implementation . ?? . 6 Testing/Debugging . Successes . I made the app fairly user-friendly. I added sounds to make it more entertaining and allowed 2 seconds of rest between each question | I think I designed the background and layout pretty well. The colors are soothing and images are interesting to look at | I found a way to calculate the user&#39;s score using a variable | . Challenges &amp; Discoveries . Sometimes I would forget to name each button, element, and image and I would command the wrong one which would make my app just appear to not be doing anything --&gt; For my second creation I made sure to name each element so I don&#39;t confuse myself again | I couldn&#39;t find a way to combine the similar code among different buttons into one chunk. I had to code almost the same exact thing for each wrong answer and each correct answer. Next time I need to utilize for loops and if statements | . How it works: . First, I defined and set a variable, score to 0. This will be used to calculate the user&#39;s end score out of 3 | I set the screen to &quot;homescreen&quot;, which is where the user should start | When the user clicks the &quot;start quiz&quot; button, the app takes them to the first question screen and plays a soothing &quot;start sound&quot;. However because when I designed the screen for the first question there is the &quot;correct answer!&quot; text, I must first hide this element so it doesn&#39;t appear until later | For the first question the correct answer is cos(x). Thus, if the user clicks cos(x) 1 is added to the score variable. The text &quot;correct answer!&quot; appears and a positive sound is played. The screen then changes to the next question in 2 seconds. This time is meant to make it less abrupt and friendly to user | If the user presses any other answer for example -cos(x), the score stays the same. I show the element &quot;correct answer!&quot; but change the text color to red and replace the text with &quot;wrong answer&quot;. A negative sound plays and it waits 2 seconds until the next question | Same process for the second question | Once the user answers the third question, the screen is taken to the results screen. However, because the score for each user is different, I set the &quot;score_result&quot; text to the variable score that has been accumulating the user&#39;s amount of correct answers. | Future learning . I need to learn how to make a function and pass multiple parameters so that the code can cope with multiple situations. (Procedural Abstraction) | I need to use a list/dictionary to simplify code into one flexible section. For example, all questions and answer choices are in a dictionary, create function that calls each set on one screen. (Managing Complexity) | Includes sequencing, selection, or iteration. For example, how list is used or a for loop. (Algorithm Implementation) | . Creation 2: &quot;Are you a Summer or Winter person?&quot; . Press on me! . Here is a second app I made for fun. I always loved taking buzzfeed quizzes as a kid for fun, they told me a little more about myself even if it was an innaccurate judgement! . Something different: A difference between this buzzfeed quiz and my derivative quiz, is that I made 2 variables, a function, and used an if statement . I made a variable summer and a variable winter, I initialized both to 0 | I defined a function called &quot;setResult&quot; that set a variable max equal to summer, so assuming that the user has more summer answers than winter answers. I would then set the variable result to the text &quot;summer&quot;. If the number of winter answers was greater than max (summer answers), the max would now be set to winter, and result would be text &quot;winter&quot;. To make the sentence on the result screen the same words, I made a label that would only replace the word &quot;summer&quot; or &quot;winter&quot; in the sentence &quot;you are a __ person!&quot; | .",

Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet.

Types of Variables: String, Integer, Float, List, and Dictionary In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. . # variable of type string name = &quot;Emma Shen&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 100.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;Html&quot;, &quot;CSS&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[3]&quot;, langs[3], type(langs[3])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) ###REVERSED ORDER##### fruits = [&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot;, &quot;Grape&quot;] fruits.reverse() print(&#39; nReversed List:&#39;, fruits) ###PRINT IN RANDOM ORDER#### import random print(&quot; nAre you bored?

List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values #added records for my gender, phone number, and age InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Shen&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;July 29&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;aimashen.2017@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: &quot;858-705-5930&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;16&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Listening to music&quot;, &quot;Baking&quot;,] }) #my partner info in dictionary InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Vivian&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Ni&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;May 13&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;vivianni452@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: &quot;410-227-5596&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;16&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Cybersecurity&quot;, &quot;Graphic design&quot;,] }) import getpass, sys ####User&#39;s input added to list### FirstName = input(&quot;Enter your first name: &quot;) LastName = input(&quot;Enter your last name: &quot;) Gender = input(&quot;Enter your gender: &quot;) DOB = input(&quot;Enter your birthday: &quot;) Residence = input(&quot;Enter your city: &quot;) Email = input(&quot;Enter your email: &quot;) PhoneNumber = input(&quot;Enter your phone number (with dashes in between): &quot; ) Age = input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;) #for loop for hobbies, since want multiple outputs Hobbies=[] max_length = 3 while len(Hobbies) &lt; max_length: userHobby = input(&quot;Enter a hobby you enjoy: &quot;) Hobbies.append(userHobby) print(Hobbies) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: FirstName, &quot;LastName&quot;: LastName, &quot;Gender&quot;: Gender, &quot;DOB&quot;: DOB, &quot;Residence&quot;: Residence, &quot;Email&quot;: Email, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: PhoneNumber, &quot;Age&quot;: Age, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: Hobbies, }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of Dictionary Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Gender:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Gender&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Email:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Phone Number:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;PhoneNumber&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobbies: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;Formatted for loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

While loop In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Emma&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Shen&#39;, &#39;Gender&#39;: &#39;Female&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;July 29&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;aimashen.2017@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;PhoneNumber&#39;: &#39;858-705-5930&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;: &#39;16&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: [&#39;Tennis&#39;, &#39;Listening to music&#39;, &#39;Baking&#39;]} {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Vivian&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Ni&#39;, &#39;Gender&#39;: &#39;Female&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;May 13&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;vivianni452@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;PhoneNumber&#39;: &#39;410-227-5596&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;: &#39;16&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: [&#39;Art&#39;, &#39;Cybersecurity&#39;, &#39;Graphic design&#39;]} {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;alexa&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;murphy&#39;, &#39;Gender&#39;: &#39;female&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;july 28&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;la&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;alfjweoef@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;PhoneNumber&#39;: &#39;868-494-2938&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;: &#39;19&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: [&#39;eating&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;]} . Recursion (calling a loop repeatedly) This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .
