<strong>Question 1 </strong>
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/question1.png "Question 1")
Answer: x = 3, y = 2, z = 1 
Confusion: Didn’t realize that even after first if statement is fulfilled, if next if statement statement also is fulfilled, latter max value overrides former max value 

<strong>Question 5</strong>

Answer: 
temp = a 
a = b 
b = temp 
Explanation: Remember that first line must always have a variable stored to temp. Be careful of silly mistakes like this

<strong>Question 12</strong>

Answer: B 
Note: Testing relationship between AND and OR. 
A: Doesn’t make sense elevator on floor 1 AND on floor 2 
B: Yes makes sense that if on floor 1 and called to 2, OR on floor 2 and called 1 → move 
C: Doesn’t make sense that on floor 1 OR go to floor 2 
D: same thing as C 

<strong>Question 41</strong>

Answer: 
Random(1, 5) = 1 
Random(1, 10) <= 2>
Explanation: 
The statement Random (1 , 5) could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. There is a one out of five, or 20 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 1. If this happens, the value of  sum is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate.
The statement Random (1.10) could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. There is a two out of 10, or 20 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 1 or 2. If this happens, the value of  sum is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate.

<strong>Question 45</strong>
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/question45.png "Question 45")
Answer: When the problem cannot be solved in a reasonable time and an approximate solution is acceptable
Explanation: Didn't know what heuristic approach is. Now I know it means: Heuristics is an approach to problem-solving in which the objective is to produce a working solution within a reasonable time frame. Instead of looking for a perfect solution, heuristic strategies look for a quick solution that falls within an acceptable range of accuracy.
