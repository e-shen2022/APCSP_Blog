**Wrong Answer Explanations**

<mark>Binary Hacks</mark>
Q3 254 --> binary 
My Answer: 11111111
Correct Answer: 11111110
Answer explanation: I forgot that the decimal place on the very right indicates if the number is odd or not. Since 254 is even, I know that the digit on very right should be 0, not 1.

Q9 
My Answer: 7. 1, 3, 4
Correct Answer: 6. 1, 4
Answer explanation: I momentarily forgot that index starts at 0, therefore Avocado in the list would be index 4 

**Reflection**
Today I learned about variables, how to name them, types of variables, lists, and binary numbers. 
String --> a word or group of characters not be changed numerically, just a phrase (ex. "hello", "858-705-5930")
Boolean --> True of False
Integer --> whole number 
Float --> number with decimal point 
Name a variable thoughtfully, not just randomly. (ex. If you were naming a boolean variable to determine if an object is the color pink, name the variable isPink.)
Lists - you can combine lists together, and have multiple types of variables in a list
Converting binary to decimal numbers is just a matter of knowing what each decimal point represents.
