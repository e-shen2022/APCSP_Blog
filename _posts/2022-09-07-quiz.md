<h2>Design 1 </h2>
<p>Idea: a quizz testing you knowledge of the calculus derivatives</p>
<p>Origin of Idea: Memory of the many derivatives is essential in succeeding in Calculus. I am currently struggling to remember the derivatives after a summer of almost math, so I hope this quiz can jog my own memory and help others as well! This is meant to be a quick and easy study tool. </p>
