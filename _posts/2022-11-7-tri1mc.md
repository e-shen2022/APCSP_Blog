![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ss4.png "Q34")
Explanation: The code segment initializes firstList to contain ["guitar", "drums", "bass"], secondList to contain ["flute", "violin"], and thirdList to contain an empty list. The code segment then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to thirdList, then secondList to firstList, then thirdList to secondList.

Explanation: Answer choice A and D are correct. I forgot to check Answer A. This code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time > 120.
