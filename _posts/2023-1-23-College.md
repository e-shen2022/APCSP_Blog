Row 2: Data Abstraction 
- [X] Includes two program segments: 1. that shows how data has been stored in a list. 2. that shows the data in the same list used to fulfill the program purpose
- [X] Identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used
- [] Describes what data in the list is representing the program
- [] Point?


Row 3: Managing Complexity
- [X] Includes a code segment that shows a list that manages the complexity of the program

### Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard?
- The only discrepency I had was in managing complexity. I was fooled by their list and explaination, but it turns out that the list didnt actually manage the complexity of the program.

### Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard
- This submission isnt the worst one ive ever seen, but it was still pretty bad because it didn't hit specific details. For the ones it missed, they attempted everyhting but just missed one specific detail such as desrcibing the functionality or the parameters that lost them the whole point.

### Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard?
- This student made both mine and college boards jobs very easy, this was absolutely perfect according to collegeboards standards.

### Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard
- This one met all the standards because of their beautiful explainations.

<mark>My Score: 1/6<mark>
## College Board Score: 1/6

### Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard?
- On this one I managed to have no discrepencies with collegeboard. I think this is because I have done so many at this point, I know what the good and bad requirements look like.

### Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard
- This submission was missing a whole lot, it had most of the actual coding however the explainations were far below standards which is definately why they got a 1/6 in real life.

### Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard?
- This one was very easy to grade because it had everything perfectly until the Testing requiremnt where they did it so poorly that it was easy to take away that point.

### Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard
- For the testing category I feel that that barely even looked at the requirements and described none of the calls, and just the code themselves which is obviously not what college board asked to. Overall a great project but it could have been perfect if they paid more attention to the last requirement.


# Overall Reflection:
- Overall, these college board scoring assingments were extremely beneficial in teaching me how to get a great score on my own CPT project. Prior to these assignemtns, I barely knew what one of these projects were supposed to look like, but now I have a great perspective and many ideas of what I can do to make my one. This assigment especially taught me all the ways to meet colllegeboards requirements, such as the extreme detail that is needed in explainations of certain things like functionality vs contribution to program. Additionally paying close details to the requirements is going to be extremely important, because one small slip up will lose an entire point. FInally, comparing the best and the worst projects really gave me a perspective on how I am going to do my own project and how I will be going above and beyond in order to ensure the perfection of my own CPT.
