        <th>The video shows clear inputs and oupts for animal icons/questions program. However, the commentary does not describe the problem solved by the program and demonstrates the functionality, describing the inputs and outputs of the program, but collegeborad believes that challenging the user's memory is not considered an interaction and this response does not describe the functionality shown in the video.

        Video shows clear input, functionality, and output. (3a) Write up describes overall purpose, functionality, and inputs/outputs of program</th>

Comparing to College Board rubric: 

Row 1 did not recieve credit because student describes functionality but not PURPOSE of program. Why did he create a program that gives info about trig side lengths? 

Row 3 did not recieve credit because the list is not neccessary for the functionality of the program. To be necessary the items in the list should be looped through and checked. But in this case, the return statements are not needed, you could just print those words to output "Classification by side"

        <th>Row 6 Testing</th>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>(3d and 3c) write up: describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. identifies the result of each call. </th>

Comparing to College Board rubric: 6/6
- no difference between my scoring and college board rubric
- very thorough and unique game function
