Based on your current symptoms, your mostly likely sickness is amebiasis.

We advise you to take a definitive diagnosis of ambiasis by stool examination to identify the parasite. The standard treatment for ambiasis includes a course of antibiotics such as metronidazole or tinidazole, which are used to kill the parasite. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment as the infection can lead to serious complications if left untreated.

Amebiasis can also cause dehydration and malnutrition due to diarrhea and vomiting. It is important to maintain hydration and provide adequate nutrition to help the body fight the infection! 

Of course, don&#39;t forget to get lots of rest! Stay safe and we wish you good health!
