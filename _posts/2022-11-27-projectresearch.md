<strong>3.15 Random Value</strong>

Function: random (a, b) â†’ generates a random integer from a to b inclusive. Provides 1 number at a time. Each execution of a random number generator may produce a different result each time. 

Ex. random(1, 5) could return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Understanding check --> Lower range of 2 ranges will be added, higher range of 2 ranges will be added 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/random1.png "Yes")

Real-world example

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/random2.png "Yes")

Block-code example

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/random3.png "Yes")

<strong>Possible Hacks</strong>
- Create a probability math problem and solve the problem using the random function
Ex. A die contains 8 sides with dots 1 through 8 on individual sides. Write a code segment that can be used to simulate the results of rolling the die 3 times and assigns the sum of the values obtained by the rolls to the variable "sum"
