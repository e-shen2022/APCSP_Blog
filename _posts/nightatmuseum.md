<h1>Ceramics üç∂üè∫‚ö±</h1>

I really enjoyed the artwork from the ceramics students. While when I think of the word "art" I usually think of  sketches, paintings, and more stereotypical art forms, it is important to recognize and appreciate mediums such as forming unique figures made of clay and hardening them into practical and artistic objects. The students made a variety of structures such as teapots, statues, plates, cups, and more. They all had their own color theme and ideas. A few of my personal favorites was a tea cup that was in the shape of a turtle and the body was in the texture of a turtle's shell, a cup that had a simple but elegant look with vines growing around the surface, and snakes that curled around a cup that looked like it was for when you brush your teeth and need to wash your mouth with water. However, my favorite favorite was this art piece:

Although the first time I laid eyes on it I physically flinched, the more I looked at the more I was in awe of how realistically gory and perfectly crafted it was. The most prominent aspect was the way the bat was able to balance and not fall over while being "stuck" in the human's mouth. The person's facial expression also just speaks to me in the way that they seeem surprised and eerie at the same time. Makes me think whether this person is forced to eat the bat or not. Anyways, just wanted to share this one with y'all.

When I was first browsing this painting I felt an indescribable sense of warmth. For me, I saw my grandmother and grandfather feeding me authentic chinese dishes made with love. The last time I went to my family's hometown was 6 years ago. It's been too long and this image brings me back to the qing zheng yu which means natural fish in Chinese that was my favorite dish. I can see my grandmother's enthusiastic smile and chopstick feeding me noodles and my grandfather's wholesome eye smile as he drinks his soup. I feel at home here.

One project I really liked in Mort's room was one where any student at DNHS can submit their club to be on a master sheet and other students can leave their reviews of the clubs. I think that this is a website needed at our school and would organize information very nicely and be very helpful for people looking to join activities they are interested in. Having an alumni review of what the club is like and what they gained from it is very cool!
