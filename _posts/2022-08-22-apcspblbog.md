**Welcome to my APCSP Blog!**

<p>Here is where I will document my learning in AP Computer Science Principles every week!</p>

# Week 1
 - I downloaded all the tools and equipment needed for this class 
 - I learned basic cs vocabulary such as input, output, sequence, and key/value
 - I learned Python Linux commands (pwd, cd, mkdirr, ls)
 - I learned how to make markdown posts and jupyter notebooks
 - I used Python to create a 6-question quiz 
 - I used a jupyter notebook to write code that checks to see if I have the right packages installed (Bash)
 - I searched up by myself how to make my website have a background color and text-align the title in the middle 
 - I made a study guide I can update throughout the year for all of my classes
