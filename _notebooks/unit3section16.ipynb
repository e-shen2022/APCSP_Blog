    "<strong>What is a simulation?</strong>\n",
    "-simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena\n",
    "-removes details that are too difficult to simulate\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Advantages of using a simulation</strong>\n",
    "1. Safer - avoid safety hazards in real-life experimentation\n",
    "2. Less expensive - don't need to buy real-world equipment, just abstract simulation! \n",
    "3. Repeatable - once a simulation is created, it's easy to repeat  it to get different but similar results \n",
    "4. Can make predictions - use previous data to predict what will happen in the future \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Examples</strong>\n",
    "- Rolling a dice must account for air resistance and velocity of the throw --> create a psuedo random number generator that can randomly generate a number from the 6 sides \n",
    "- Airplane transportation must account for weather, air resistance, etc --> run multiple simulations with variety of outside factor conditions \n",
