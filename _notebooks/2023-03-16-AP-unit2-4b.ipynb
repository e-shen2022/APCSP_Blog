    "\n",
    "- Focus: Imperative programming focuses on how to achieve a specific task, while OOP focuses on the creation and manipulation of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Structures: In imperative programming, data structures are often simple arrays or structures, while in OOP, they are typically more complex objects with their own attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance: In OOP, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, allowing for code reuse and increased modularity. In imperative programming, code is often duplicated or reused by copying and pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, OOP is often seen as more organized, modular, and reusable than imperative programming. However, imperative programming can be more efficient for certain tasks, particularly those that involve a lot of low-level manipulation of data. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the programmer."
