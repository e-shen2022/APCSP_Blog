<ul>
  <li>This one was very easy to grade because it had everything perfectly until the Testing requiremnt where they did it so poorly that it was easy to take away that point.</li>

  <li>For the testing category I feel that that barely even looked at the requirements and described none of the calls, and just the code themselves which is obviously not what college board asked to. Overall a great project but it could have been perfect if they paid more attention to the last requirement.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Overall, these college board scoring assingments were extremely beneficial in teaching me how to get a great score on my own CPT project. Prior to these assignemtns, I barely knew what one of these projects were supposed to look like, but now I have a great perspective and many ideas of what I can do to make my one. This assigment especially taught me all the ways to meet colllegeboards requirements, such as the extreme detail that is needed in explainations of certain things like functionality vs contribution to program. Additionally paying close details to the requirements is going to be extremely important, because one small slip up will lose an entire point. FInally, comparing the best and the worst projects really gave me a perspective on how I am going to do my own project and how I will be going above and beyond in order to ensure the perfection of my own CPT.</li>
